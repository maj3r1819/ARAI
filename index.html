    <h1>Nature is not a place to visit. It is home.</h1>
    <p>My name is Sagar and this is my website where I have tried to document my weekend getaways to ARAI which is a nature hike trail
    near my house. I am always accompanied by my friends Siraj, Soham (Bote) and Siraj's dog Ferro and sometimes by SD.
        This place is a treat to our mind and relaxes us from the city ruckus. It is always a treat to witness the changing seasons
        throughout the year. Please scroll below to enjoy our journey so far.

            <p>This was one of the rare times we visited here in the morning. Surprisingly it wasn't that hot as we
                expected. We planned to go out for breakfast in the morning but unfortunately all the breakfast joints were
                shut because of the weekend lockdown.
                Sadly this was probably the last time this year
                we could go here. We are waiting desparately for the lockdown to end and for things to get better.

                I took this just before what we think was a "Paranormal Encounter". It was pitch dark and we don't usually
                see anyone at such hours. To our disregard we believe we were chased by a lady who was sprinting at the same
                pace as were running. It was definitely some experience we never had before.

                One of the better sunsets I have witnessed here. Thanks to the abundant rainfall we received last year,
                the level of the quarry water did not fall too low. This is a prime spot and is mostly crowded. Luckily
                I got a good view away from the crowd!

                Tbh this does not seem like a very good picture. But I took it because I liked the contrast of the colours,
                ranging from blue to yellowish-orange and how the image gradually got darker at the bottom. Also the water
                was quite calm at the time.

                We love to see the moon even when there is still light around. I doubt there's anything more relaxing than
                clear sky and the wide abyss.
